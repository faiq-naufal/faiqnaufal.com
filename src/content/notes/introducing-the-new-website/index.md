## Introduction

I'm very excited to present my new personal website. My old
website was created at 2018. The website itself wasn't really
scallable to put more content. After some considerations, I
thought I really needed to revamp the whole website. I wanted the
new website to be faster, more accessible, SEO-friendly,
minimalistic and fun. I originally planned to revamp the website
on last year but I didn't have an inspiration and time to do it.
This new website is intended to be my personal value for my
professional career and hobby.

## What's inside the website?

The website is broken down into five section of pages to
separate and make each part is easier to navigate:

- **Home**

The root and homepage of the website. This is the page that
welcomes you as you visit the website.

- **About**

A place where I tell about my info, background and my personal
core values. I also provide other useful info such as list of
my skills and my productivity tools.

- **Showcase**

A place where I put and showcase all my projects whether it is
my personal project, learning project or professional project.
Each project has detail page which provides the information
about the project itself. The detail page may provides
informations such as the technologies used, description /
background of the project, project screenshot, and how the
project is created.

- **Contact**

Welcome to contact page, a place where you can contact and
share stories with me. You can message me with subject
literally anything from here with the exception of spam or
marketing message of course.

- **Note**

Hey, right now you are on this section of website. A note page
is basically made up of my random thoughts and notes which I
like to share with everyone.

That's all folks. This is the first note from this website. I plan
to write more next time whenever I have some thoughts to share.
Anyway, thank you so much for reaching this far.
