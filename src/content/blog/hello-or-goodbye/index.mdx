# Hello

I think I want this post to be üëâ "me" welcoming you on this website. Anyway, thank you for visiting my personal website and taking your time reading my random thoughts üòÅ.

Let's start with introducing myself again even though you probably already know me from the title of this site. This is Faiq Naufal and at the time of this writing I'm in the process of becoming of software engineer based on Indonesia. My current focus is on the front end side of web platform technologies. What does it means? It means I have interests on design, interaction, user interface and user experience on the website. I also like my visitor enjoy in my website so I will try my best on maintaining this place. Beside that I also have interests on various things such as traveling, music, anime, game, and nature.

I usually listen music while working. That refreshes my mind and imagination. I usually go with instrumental or ost kind music. Sounds weird right? I rarely to see people have taste similar with me. Feel free to tell me if you have different music tastes.

# Motivation

I want this website to be a medium that can bridge my thought with people online. As an ambivert, I sometimes have difficulties of speaking what's currently on my mind with others. This site will be my front face whenever I have something to share with you all. This also will be my place to put my portfolios and resume whenever I apply on job.

# Good Bye?

Wait, is it really good bye? We probably just met here and I don't think we already know each other better. Just a peek on other post and you can call it a day. Although I hope you can come back and telling your side of stories.
